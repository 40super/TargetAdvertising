About Dataset
In this project, we will work with the advertising data of a marketing agency to develop a machine-learning algorithm that predicts if a particular user will click on an advertisement.
The data consists of 10 variables: 'Daily Time Spent on Site', 'Age', 'Area Income', 'Daily Internet Usage', 'Ad Topic Line', 'City', 'Male', 'Country', Timestamp' and 'Clicked on Ad'.

The primary variable we are interested in is 'Clicked on Ad'. This variable can have two possible outcomes: 0 and 1 where 0 refers to the case where a user didn't click the advertisement. In contrast, 1 refers to the scenario where a user clicks the ad.
